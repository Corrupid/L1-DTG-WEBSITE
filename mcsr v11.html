            <h4>Breif Intro</h4>
                <p>
                    This is a website for explaining the minecraft java speedrunning meta and how you can get into it too.
                    It will briefly go over the history of 1.16.1 (the main category) speedruns and linking resources you can use to 
                    start speedunning. such resources will include things like practice maps, tutorials, and explanations to complex statergies.
                    Most of the resources are for 1.16.1 because its the most speedran version but there are some things for pre 1.16.1.                                                                 
                </p>
            <h4>Hardware requirements</h4>
                <h5>CPU</h5>
                <p>
                    The main way speedrunners find good seeds is through use of 'The Wall',  this is a wall of many minecraft instances being 
                    reset simultaniously so they can find seeds way faster than just using a single instance. This is a great stratergy for 
                    efficiency however, this process is very CPU (central core processor) intensive, meaning that for getting good seeds, it is faster to have a 
                    CPU with high core and thread count for a higher amount of instances. Some of the most popular choices I have seen are:
                </p>
                <ul>-Ryzen 9 5900x</ul>
                <ul>-Ryzen 9 5950x</ul>
                <ul>-Ryzen 9 5800x</ul>
                <ul>-Ryzen 9 7950x</ul>
                <p>Nobody really uses Intel CPUs that much because of the intablility and worse price to performance. But any i9 should be powerful enough.</p>
                <h5>GPU</h5>
                <p>As for your graphics card, this doesnt really matter a whole lot, many top speedrunners are rocking
                    cards like the RX 570 or GTX 970 but with a good CPU like the ones above. the only thing you need to
                    consider is the frames you want and if the card is suffecient and doesnt lag often. </p>
                <h5>RAM</h5>
                <p>More ram is always good to have as it can aid with the world creation speed and make the world resetting 
                    process faster. Most top runners will have at least 32gb of ram and have around 7-12gb allocated to Minecraft,
                    however you can realistically get away with 16gb if thats all you have.

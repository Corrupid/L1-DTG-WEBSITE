                In minecraft java, there is one main stratergy for beating the game the fastest, this is called hypermodern.
                Players will reset worlds until the spawn on a forested island, they will then use the pie chart on the f3 
                screen to find buried treasure without a map (this is called mapless treasure), from this they will get a 
                surplus of iron, gold, and diamonds, as well as enough food to last them the duration of the run. 
                They will now take to the ocean to find a magma ravine which they will use to create a nether portal under
                the water, all of this happens in less than 2 minutes idealy. once in the nether, runners will use the f3 screen's
                entity counter to find a bastion, after ariving, they will get piglins to follow them into a pit they made to trade 
                with them with maximum efficiency, from the piglins they will get:
            </p>
            <ul>- Ender pearls, for travel and making eyes of ender to fill the end portal</ul>
            <ul>- String, this can be used to craft wool which can then be turned into beds, these explode in the end and will the how they kill the ender dragon</ul>
            <ul>- glowstone and crying obsidian, these can be crafted into respawn anchors which also explode in the end, speedrunners want four explosives at the very least</ul>
            <ul>- fire resistance potions, as the name suggests, this will make you immune to fire damage which will hevily aid nether travel and blaze fighting </ul>
            <ul>- obsidian, to be used to make a new nether portal so the runner can leave the nether faster</ul>
            <p>
                Once they get all of these, they will once again use the pie chart, this time to locate the blaze spawner in a nether 
                fortress. In the fortress they will either look for stray blazes or use the blaze spawner. when they get 5-7 blaze rods 
                they will use the obsidian to build a new nether portal to leave the nether. in the over world they throw one eye of 
                ender and measure the angle and use a calculator to find the exact location of the stronghold, after this, they will 
                return to the nether because one block in the nether is 8 in the overworld so its way faster, once at the coordinates
                given by the calculator, they will build a portal that will put them right inside the stronghold. this is where the 
                piechart makes its final apearance, they use a stratergy much like the one use for mapless treasure to find the direction 
                of the portal room. once in the end, there are two main ways of killing the dragon:  </p>
            <ul>- Onecycle: this relies on the dragon perching at the center for the player to kill with beds, this is easy but is very luck dependant because the dragon can either be really fast at perching or take ages, killing the run.</ul>
            <ul>- Zerocycle: this is WAY harder than onecycle, but it can be used to get consistantly sub minute end fight times. the main reason zerocycling is hard is the fact that there are many setups, orientations, rotations, and hights that you have to memorise to pull it off</ul>
            <p>
                So thats roughly how speedrunners kill the ender dragon less than 15 minutes after creating the world, keep in mind this is hevily reliant on the world you get and wont be possible with a bad world

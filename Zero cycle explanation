                this is WAY harder than onecycle, but it can be used to get consistantly sub minute end fight times. the main 
                reason zerocycling is hard is the fact that there are many setups, orientations, rotations, and hights that you have to 
                memorise to pull it off. The way it works is pretty complicated, when you spawn into the end, the ender dragon will choose 
                a node to circle around, there are four different nodes:

        <ul>
            <li>
                Front Diagonal, this is the front right tower, its considered to be the easiest of all the locations because of how fast you 
                can get there.
            </li>
            <li>
                Back diagonal, this is the back left tower, its slighty harder than front diagonal because it will usually need an extra
                ender pearl to get to the tower due to it being on the other side of the island. This means that its harder to go for a 
                higher y level resulting in a slower time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Front straight, this is not like the diagonal setups, for straight the dragon will circle further from the tower, this
                means you will have to quickly bridge over to make the setup to kill the dragon.  
            </li>
            <li>
                Back straight, this is basically the same as front straight except you have to bridge off the back tower.
            </li>
            <p>In the end, there are ten obsidian towers, all of them are different heights and widths, so they will need differnt setups for 
                each, here are the names and y level of every tower (smallest to biggest):
            </p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Small boy, y76</li>
            <li>Small cage, y83</li>
            <li>M85, y85</li>
            <li>Large cage, y86</li>
            <li>M88, y88</li>
            <li>M91, y91</li>
            <li>T94, y94</li>
            <li>T97, y97</li>
            <li>T100, y100</li>
            <li>Tall boy, y103</li>
        </ul>
            <p>
                When doing zero cycles its important to know the possible heights for each tower, most of the hights are standardised so its 
                not hard to learn:
            </p>
            <ul>
                Diagonal:
                <li>86/87</li>
                <li>90/91</li>
                <li>94/95</li>
                <li>99/100</li>
                <li>103/104</li>
                <li>108(VERY hard)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                Straight:
                <li>86</li>
                <li>88</li>
                <li>91</li>
                <li>93</li>
                <li>95</li>
                <li>97</li>
                <li>99</li>
                <li>101</li>
                <li>103</li>
                <li>106(VERY hard)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Keep in mind that all this is very base level info, if you are keen to learn, I would recomend getting a proper video tutorial 
                with examples as it will be easier than learning from text. This isnt something you master in an hour, this will take a good
                amount of practice to get right.
